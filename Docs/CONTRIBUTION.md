# Contribution

First thanks for testing the project, you can contribute with SDM by your:

- [Developing](./CONTRIBUTION.md#development)
- [Bug fixing](./CONTRIBUTION.md#fixing-bugs)
- [Seggesting](./CONTRIBUTION.md#suggesstion)
- [Distributing](./CONTRIBUTION.md#distributing)



## Development

Base on license you can do everything with code but, it is good to follow the developer guidelines for the integrity in coding style and logic.

Visit [Developer guidelines](./Dev/DEV_GUIDE.md).


## Fixing bugs

Human creations are not perfect and errorless so, if you find or confront with any errors feel free to fix it and send a **pull request**.


## Suggesstion
SDM is still under development and it has long way to become full feature project. If you feel something is not correct or missing from project or think adding X feature is useful or necessary then don't hesitate and send your suggestion on **pull request** or in **discussions**.

## Distributing
Products are meant to be used, if they don't anyone can't say for sure that they are doing the their tasks correctly or not. Please even for once use SDM and if you like it, suggest it to others. The more comment we get the more idea we have.
